# Python-AdBlocker-Script
Python script that creates a customized, efficient adblocking hosts file. Basically it checks the user's DNS cache and sees if any entries there are listed in the popular hosts files. If so, it adds those entries to the user's hosts file. The purpose is to keep the hosts file small and avoid adverse effects on browsing speed.
